# Thread & Cloth
## About this mod
In the **Thread & Cloth** mod, you will be able to craft **dyeable** **thigh-highs**. It adds a brand new **cotton bush** which you will be able to find in _plains_ and _forest_ biomes. This bush works similarly to a berry bush, except it won't hurt you and you'll get **cotton** from it.

**Thigh-highs** are made from **cloth**, which you make from **thread** and then from **cotton** that you collect. You can also craft a **cloth block**, but it is just for decoration.

This mod _may or may not_ be updated in the future. If so, expect to see more **clothing** and more related stuff.

## Screenshots
